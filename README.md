To improve the fine-grained few-shot proposal classification, it proposed a novel attentive feature alignment method. |
| [Few-Shot Object Detection via Variational Feature Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13411.pdf) | [VFA](https://github.com/csuhan/VFA) | AAAI 2023 | PASCAL VOC, COCO | It proposed a meta-learning framework with two novel feature aggregation schemes. First a Class-Agnostic Aggregation method, then a Variational Feature Aggregation method. |
| [Meta-DETR: Image-Level Few-Shot Object Detection with Inter-Class Correlation Exploitation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00219.pdf) | [Meta-DETR](https://github.com/ZhangGongjie/Meta-DETR) | TPAMI 2022 | PASCAL VOC, COCO | It proposed Meta-DETR, which is the first image-level few-shot detector, and introduces a novel inter-class correlational meta-learning strategy to capture and leverage the correlation among different classes. |
| [Fast Hierarchical Learning for Few-Shot Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.05008.pdf) | -- | IROS 2022 | COCO | Treat few-shot detection as a hierarchical learning problem, where the novel classes are treated as the child classes of existing base classes and the background class. |
